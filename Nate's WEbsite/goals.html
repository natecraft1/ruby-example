		When I was in elementary school I was convinced I would be an actor.  Throughout college, I wanted to follow in the steps of my idol Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.  
		How else was I going to spit out lines like: "The mere probability distribution of opinions will invariably generate for strictly chance reasons; a group of people who in retrospect will appear very intelligent.  If you try to identify them in advance, you will fail."
		Point is, goals change.  I've learned a bit of Buddhism and I think it's an interesting notion and ideal to be content no matter your circumstances. It's harder in practice, at least for me.  But that's my goal.  To be happy
		despite what i'm doing and despite the ebbs and flows in life.  I've also found it's good to stay busy.  The TO-DO list in the picture is something
		I wouldnt have minded years ago.  Now I want to feel like I'm making progress.  Making something.  Learning something.  Doing something.  Meeting new people.  That's my TO-DO list.  Subject to change - without disappointment or guilt.
