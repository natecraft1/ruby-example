		I've been places, but not enough.  Spending a semester in Italy was the best decision of my life because it introduced me to the 
		wonders of travel.  I've since lived abroad for over 3 years.  2 of them being in Ljubljana, Slovenia.  I am incredibly nostalgic of 
		that place and the friends I left behind.  But at least I took something very important: the knowledge that he who lives sees, but he 
		who travels sees more, and I hope I will always continue to see more than I've seen thus far.
